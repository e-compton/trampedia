Pages can have any structure as they are simply markdown (currently [kramdown flavour](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html)) documents with some YAML metadata. However, there are some guidelines for different kinds of articles in order to keep the style consistent across the wiki. This makes it easier to find the information which you are looking for when browsing.
